To run the code, first create a file called `root_dir.txt` in the root directory of the repository, and make the contents be the path to where you want it to store data.
For example, you could set it to `/home/ollie/Documents/Instagram followers/`.

Then run `python3 analyse.py` from that directory.

**Note**: you may need to run `./install_dependencies.sh` to install the relevant dependencies first.
